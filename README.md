## ðŸ‘‹Hey there!

**`Jakub Chojnacki`**

I work as a React/Next Developer at GIAP, where I'm responsible for building complex data grids, forms, and map widgets related to the GIS sector. 
My first exposure to programming was in primary school and I always knew I wanted to become a programmer. I have tried many technologies and languages and finally settled on learning front-end when I was 16-17 (around 2017-2018). I have a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and I am currently doing my Masters in CS. The focus of my thesis will be the benefits of using a monorepo.
 
I'm a lifelong learner who enjoys testing and creating new things. **Most of my repositories are private because nowadays I don't have the time to make full projects so I tend to just fiddle with new tech on small and simple projects.** I try to keep up to date with new tech by reading articles, listening to podcasts (especially Syntax), and doing courses. I have a solid grasp of FE technologies and patterns. I also know Vue 3 and the basics of Nuxt and Nest.js (I can make a simple CRUD, nothing fancy). My current focus is to improve my backend skills.
